# High_Fantasy_Baseball_Unity_Scripts
C# Scripts for the video game High Fantasy Baseball, created in the Unity3D Game Engine

A Standalone, no install required version of the game is available in the google drive folder at this link. Here follow the notes for the most recent version:

Welcome to High Fantasy Baseball!

This is an extremely early version of the game, and thus very few mechanisms/game modes are available:

Create Mode is fully funtional, and allows you to create both Characters and Teams (Teams serve no purpose at this time).

Characters choices are limited to:

Race: Orc/Human
Class: Monk/Rogue

No Characters come built in the game, so you will need to create at least one Character to play the game.

No game Modes will work until you create at least one Character.

The only Playable Game Mode is Batting Practice (accessed via the Play mode). Controls for Batting Practice are as follows:

*Move in the batter's box: arrow keys
*Initiate Swing: Press and hold [A] to fill power meter
*Complete Swing: Release [A]
*Pause: [Esc]  Note: you cannot pause while the ball is thrown or hit. You must wait until the ball is caught or bounces at least once.
*The mouse is used for all buttons and menu selection.

During Batting practice, see the pause menu for statistics on the current BP session (average distance, average power meter, etc.)
